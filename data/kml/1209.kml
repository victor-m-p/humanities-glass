The mountains of Agrieliki, Aforismos, Kotroni, Parnitha, Penteli, and Stavrokoraki are the natural boundaries that segregate Marathon from west Attica. All these steep mountains create the borders of a small fertile zone whose southeast part ends with the sea. To the south of the Marathon plain, in the little marsh known as Mikro Elos or Brexiza, between the Agrieliki mountain and the sea, and at the borders between the modern villages of Marathon and Nea Makri, lies the so-called Sanctuary of the Egyptian Gods. The sanctuary is situated 1500 m south of the Tomb of the Athenians and its eastern part borders the coastline.</description><visibility>1</visibility><Placemark id="1209"><name>Marathon</name><description>The valley of Marathon, meaning overgrown with fennel, is situated in the northeast part of Attica from which low mountains separated, no more than 500 m high.
