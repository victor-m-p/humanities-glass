Newar Buddhists near Ilam, Pokhara, Lumbini as well as other areas may be found, but may differ in some respects to those in the ancestral homeland of the Newars: the Kathmandu Valley. This region includes primarily Kathmand, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur, and reaches up to regions such as those around Bhimphedi, Thankot, Sankhu, Banepa, and Panauti.</description><visibility>1</visibility><Placemark id="861"><name>Greater Kathmandu Valley</name><description>The Kathmandu Valley and surrounding regions where Newars and, more specifically, Newar Buddhists may be found.
