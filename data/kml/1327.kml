As such, the Huainan court in Shouchun 壽春 was a literary and cultural powerhouse, and from 154 BC onwards, Liu An played host to a large roster of retainers with diverse specialisms, organising debates on their behalf, as well as patronising other forms of creative exchange.
    Huainan existed synchronously with the early Han empire, of which Huainan was a satellite or vassal kingdom. The relationship between the imperial family in the capital at Chang’an 長安 and the royal family in Huainan was sensitive and complex. Liu An was the grandson of Han primogenitor Liu Bang 劉邦, i.e. Han Emperor Gaozu 漢高祖 (r. c. 206–195 BC), as well as uncle to Emperor Wu, the reigning emperor when he ascended to the throne in Huainan in 164 BC. The official histories of Huainan in the Shiji and Hanshu describe decades of fatal conflict between Liu An’s immediate family and their imperial relatives: Liu Chang 劉長 (198–174 BC), Liu An’s father and seventh son of Liu Bang, died in exile following the accusation of attempted treason against Emperor Wen 文帝 (r. 180–157 BC). History would repeat itself in 123–122 BC, when Emperor Wu issued an edict denouncing Liu An and his court. Liu, faced with arrest, took his own life, following which his immediate family and entourage were executed. (See A. F. P. Hulsewé, “Royal Rebels,” Bulletin de l’École française d’Extrême-Orient 69 [1981]: 315–25 for the crackdown on Huainan.) The total disintegration of relations within the extended Liu clan ran its course within Liu An’s lifetime, as the Emperor was said to have gladly received the Neishu from him only a little more than a decade earlier.
     The conflict that fractured the Liu clan, led to Liu An’s demise, and dissolved Huainan as a self-governing kingdom corresponded to a greater existential schism in the early Han regime. In its first decades, the regime oscillated between a Zhou-style 周 multi-centre confederacy of semi-autonomous kingdoms, on the one hand, and Qin-style 秦 authoritarian rule, concentrating power in the capital, on the other. However, following the Seven Kingdoms Rebellion of 154 BC, which involved large kingdoms such as Wu 吳, Chu, and Qi 齊, the central government moved to increase its power, for example setting up new commanderies. Over the decades that followed, relations between centre and periphery deteriorated rapidly, and Emperor Wu’s overall reign was marked as a “period of increased authoritarian rule.” (Griet Vankeerberghen, The Huainanzi and Liu An’s Claim to Moral Authority [Albany: State University of New York Press, 2001], 7.) In this context, the events of 123–122 BC marked a watershed, indexing the moment that the Han cast itself once and for all in the shape of a centralised autocratic empire, which, allowing a brief interregnum, ultimately endured for four centuries.
     In this precise context, the gesture of producing a Southern cosmological magnum opus and then presenting this to the Emperor indexes a complicated web of political forces. As Griet Vankeerberghen notes, Liu An’s presentation of the text in 139 BC can be (and has been) parsed in almost opposite ways, both as a strategy for showing deference to the capital as well as a means to assert the South’s cultural and moral superiority. This aspect of the text’s early life has inspired many attendant interpretations of it, with many scholars noting the contingent political implications of Huainanzi’s expansive, pluralistic cosmology, and looking to the Lius’ diplomatic situation as its possible hermeneutical key.</description><visibility>1</visibility><Placemark id="1327"><name>Huainan Kingdom</name><description>The southern kingdom of Huainan lay within the boundaries of the former state of Chu 楚, which had a distinct culture and extensive literature.
