At the center of the province is Lake Toba, which was formed after the explosion of a supervolcano some 69 - 77,000 years ago. The region is considered the home of several Batak indigenous groups: Karo, Pakpak, Simalungun, Toba, Angkola, and Mandailing. Three of these groups: Karo, Toba, and Simalungun; but most especially communities of the Toba Batak, are associated with Batak traditional religions and Batak Hinduism.</description><visibility>1</visibility><Placemark id="1325"><name>North Sumatra</name><description>North Sumatra (Sumatra Utara) is an Indonesian province on the island of Sumatra.
