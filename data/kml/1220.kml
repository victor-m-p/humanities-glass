Drukpa Kagyü monasteries are prominently situated in Western and Central Bhutan, while Eastern Bhutan has traditionally been dominated by monasteries of the Nyingma school and a few from the Drikung Kagyü school. Since the foundation of the State of Bhutan in 1625/26, fortresses (Tib. rdzong) as the seat of the religious (i. e.
