It was created in 1957, out of a division of South Kalimantan, in an effort to give Dayak people greater sovereignty. Palangkaraya, the capital, was created in a three year construction project. The population of Central Kalimantan is only a plural majority Dayak, however (46%), with Javanese (22%) also making up a significant minority of the population. Islam is the majority religion (about 75% of the population), yet it is also this region that the small Kaharingan community considers home.</description><visibility>1</visibility><Placemark id="1336"><name>Central Kalimantan</name><description>Central Kalimantan is an Indonesian province.
