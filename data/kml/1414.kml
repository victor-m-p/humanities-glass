<kml xmlns:kml="http://www.opengis.net/kml/2.2"><Document id="1414"><name>Monotheistic South Arabia</name><description>This is the region of the South Arabian homeland in which inscriptions from the Monotheistic Period are attested. However, I notably omit here the wādī Maʾsal inscriptions, which are roughly 570 km northeast of this region and claim that the Ḥimyarites submitted tribes who extended as far as lower Iraq. Robin (2012) posits that the Himyarites exercised control through almost all inner Arabia, with the possible exception of the historical oases towns in the southern Ḥijāz, which is the strip of land in modern Saudi Arabia that runs along the western coast of the Red Sea. Regardless of this broader claim of Himyarite control, political submission is not necessarily religious submission and the textual record leaves it unclear as to how thoroughly Himyarite monotheism would have been imposed in these regions outside the South Arabian homeland.</description><visibility>1</visibility><Placemark id="1414"><name>Monotheistic South Arabia</name><description>This is the region of the South Arabian homeland in which inscriptions from the Monotheistic Period are attested.
