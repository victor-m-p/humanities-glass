<kml xmlns:kml="http://www.opengis.net/kml/2.2"><Document id="56"><name>Maya Lowlands</name><description>This region encompasses the Maya Lowlands. The Southern lowlands consists of the southern portions of the Mexican states of Campeche and Quintana Roo, the Petén of northern Guatemala, and Belize. The Northern Lowlands comprises the rest of the Yucatán Peninsula. As well as being defined, loosely, by elevation and topography, the area is academically important to archaeologists who generally consider the region to be somewhat distinct from the Maya highlands (the Highlands are defined by the Chiapas highlands of Mexico and the elevated part of Guatemala).
