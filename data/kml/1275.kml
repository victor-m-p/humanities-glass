A characteristic feature of the area is the rich springs that form a floatable river, Baphyras, which flows towards the sea. Nowadays, the ancient city distances from the sea 6 km, but this distance was just 1.5 km in antiquity. The city was sacred in Macedonia. Since the fifth century BCE, its importance is highlighted when king Archelaus inaugurated the city games to honor Zeus Olympios. In addition, it was the place where important victories of both Philip II and his son, Alexander, were celebrated.
In 1978 a new unknown extra muros sanctuary was brought to light. It laid near the south fortification wall of the city and not far from the already identified sanctuary of Demeter. The presence of a sacred place in the area was already known since 1951 when a trencher was used to open a new channel that would move the riverbed a few meters on the west. During this work, which destroyed parts of the western edge of the sanctuary’s precinct, marble architectural members, plinths, and sherds were brought to light. These findings were the first evidence of an ancient building at the
place, but it was only the excavation that started in 1978 that revealed the sanctuary. Due to the water that covered the sanctuary the stratigraphy study was almost impossible, which, consequently, has created severe problems in the study and the understanding of the evolution of the sanctuary through the centuries.</description><visibility>1</visibility><Placemark id="1275"><name>Dion</name><description>The city of Dion lies in the Pierian valley, on the eastern foothills of Mount Olympus.
