'brug yul). Drukpa Kagyü monasteries are prominently situated in Western and Central Bhutan, while Eastern Bhutan has traditionally been dominated by monasteries of the Nyingma school and partially the Drikung Kagyü school. Since the foundation of the State of Bhutan in 1625/26, fortresses (Tib. rdzong) have been the seat of the religious branch, i. e. Drukpa Kagyü, and the political branch of government and are found throughout Bhutan.</description><visibility>1</visibility><Placemark id="1227"><name>Drukpa Kagyü School in Bhutan</name><description>In this map, the territory of the Bhutanese Drukpa Kagyü school is roughly equated with today's nation-state borders of Bhutan (Tib.
