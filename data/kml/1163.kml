Rooted in the teaching of the sixth century BC philosopher Pythagoras, the movement spread across Southern Italy and eventually into a modest portion of the Greek world, taking with it a strange hodgepodge of beliefs emphasizing ascetism, number symbolism, and the immortality of the soul. 
Pythagoras himself was certainly a historical figure. Born on the Aegean island of Samos around the middle of the sixth century BC, Pythagoras migrated to Croton on the boot of Italy around 530. It was there that he founded his school while also playing an important role in the politics of Magna Graecia. Pythagoras is thought to have died in Metapontum, to which he escaped as a refugee after a violent popular backlash directed at him and his followers.
Though today Pythagoras is often remembered as a man of science and mathematics (primary school students are invariably first exposed to him through the Pythagorean theorem which he discovered), in antiquity and even during his own lifetime he was also very much seen as a “holy man.” He was often identified with the Hyperborean Apollo, was said to have had a golden thigh, and allegedly claimed to remember his previous incarnations. Classical and post-classical authorities depict him acquiring his impressive knowledge and abilities while traveling in Egypt and the East. Such early accounts are almost invariably fanciful – in some legends Pythagoras is said to have proved the immortality of the soul by descending to the underworld – but it is not impossible that an Ionian of the sixth century should have brought together elements of Babylonian mathematics, Persian religion, and Indian philosophical doctrines.
The Pythagorean life was based on strict rules that regulated all aspects of existence from diet and clothing to intellectual activity. These rules (called akousmata or symbola) were, at least at first, based on oral teachings of the master; initiated members were called akousmatikoi and lived in tight-knit communities (which were apparently open to women as well as men). Among the most prominent rules was vegetarianism based on the doctrine of metempsychosis (that is, the transmigration of the immortal soul). Other rules emphasized ascetism, harmony, justice, and moral purity.
By the end of Pythagoras’ life, Pythagorean societies across Magna Graecia were subject to increasingly violent attacks, and around 450 BC Pythagorean power in Croton came to an end. The movement began to fray and was eventually split into two parts: the religious akousmatikoi who continued to follow Pythagoras’ oral teachings, and the scientific mathematikoi who chiefly pursued mathematical and cosmological learning. Many Pythagoreans became mendicants or migrated to other parts of the Greek world, whether in Italy or mainland Greece. Pythagoras’ teachings were thus widely disseminated. As a religious movement, the Pythagoreans seems to have had an abiding influence on several cults, especially that of the Orphics, with whom their doctrines coincided on several important points (especially vegetarianism and their belief in the immortality of the soul). Pythagorean thought also had an important influence on philosophers such as Philolaus in the late fifth century BC and Plato in the fourth century BC. In the first century BC, the Pythagorean movement was revived in Rome by Nigidius Figulus. Around the same time, the Platonist Eudorus in Alexandria attributed to the Pythagoreans a supreme One, and this monistic Platonism was soon developed by the so-called Neopythagoreans: Moderatus of Gades in the first century CE, Nicomachus of Gerasa and Numenius of Apamea in the second century CE. This movement eventually influenced the Neoplatonism of Plotinus in the third century CE. Porphyry and Iamblichus both wrote lives of Pythagoras, representing the founder of Pythagoreanism as a larger-than-life holy man and as the precursor to much of Platonic philosophy. Despite this enduring popularity of Pythagorean ideas, however, it is disputed whether religious Pythagoreanism survived in any meaningful way after the classical period. It was during this period that the Golden Words, a collection of life rules attributed to Pythagoras himself, surfaced in written form. And though pseudoepigraphical Pythagorean writings continued to be produced throughout the Hellenistic period, religious Pythagorean communities – always something of a fringe movement – would never regain the importance and popularity they had in the sixth and fifth centuries BC.</description><visibility>1</visibility><Placemark id="1163"><name>Southern Italy and Greece</name><description>Pythagoreanism, like some of the East Asian lifestyles which it eerily recalls, lies somewhere between philosophy, mysticism, and religion.
