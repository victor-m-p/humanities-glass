## Overview

Code for "Inferring Cultural Landscapes with the Inverse Ising Model" (https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/25/2/264/html)
has been migrated to https://github.com/victor-m-p/cultural-landscapes. See that repository for documentation.
For related work on the DRH, see also: https://github.com/victor-m-p/cognitive-attractors. 
This workspace contains the most up-to-date implementation of ```/MPF_CMU``` and some core preprocessing of the DRH data
used across different analyses efforts.

### ```/MPF_CMU``` 

MPF_CMU contains the optimized C code to implement all of the extensions and modifications to MPF described in our paper. Many of the simulations were carried out on the Bridges2 Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center system, and for speed they are set up to use multiple cores with OpenMP. You will want to adjust the Makefile to compile on your local system. Note that the compiler that ships with the new Mac M1s does not support OpenMP; you will need to install a (non-Apple) clang compiler.

Some of this code is compute intensive; on a Mac M1 with 10 cores, for example, it takes a few seconds to fit n=20 with a few hundred observations, and a few minutes to do the same with Cross Validation.

MPF has seven different modes:

// mpf -l [filename] [logsparsity] [NN] // load in data, fit

Given a data file, a log-sparsity choice, and a specification of \mathcal{N}_i, produces a parameter fit file. e.g.,

./mpf -l test.dat 1.0 1

will fit using a lambda equal to 10^1.0, and the \mathcal{N}_1 strategy.

// mpf -c [filename] [NN] // load in data, fit, using cross-validation to pick best sparsity

The same as above, but does cross-validation to find the best value of lambda.

// mpf -g [filename] [n_nodes] [n_obs] [beta] // generate data, save both parameters and data to files

Generates a simulated dataset, with n_nodes nodes, and n_obs observations, with J and h drawn from a Gaussian with RMS equal to beta.

// mpf -t [filename] [paramfile] [NN] // load in test data, fit, get KL divergence from truth

If you know the true parameters (e.g., because you previously ran mpf -g), this will fit data, and tell you how well you did.

// mpf -o [filename_prefix] [NN] // load in data (_data.dat suffix), find best lambda using _params.dat to determine KL

If you know the true parameters, this will tell you the secret best value of lambda.

// mpf -k [filename] [paramfile_truth] [paramfile_inferred] // load data, compare truth to inferred

If you have previously fit some data, but you also know the true parameters, this will tell you how well you did.

// mpf -z [paramfile] [n_nodes]  // print out probabilities of all configurations under paramfile

If you have a parameter file, this will print out all the configurations, the energy for each config, and the probability.
